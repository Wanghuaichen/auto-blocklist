\section{Conclusion}
We built a block list of 1125 censored websites in China that are not
present on the largest block
list~\cite{darer2017filteredweb}. Furthermore, our list is
12.5$\times$ larger than the most widely used block
list~\cite{citizenlab:block}. It contains human rights organizations,
minority news outlets, religious blogs, political dissent groups,
privacy-enhancing technology providers, and more. We've made our
source code and block list available on
GitHub~\cite{censorsearch-lists}.

Automatically detecting which websites are censored in a given country
is an open problem. Approaches like ours and that of FilteredWeb are
steps in the right direction, but there is more work to be done.  One
way of improving our work would be to experiment with advanced
natural-language processing techniques to identify better search
terms. For example, we could try using Stanford CoreNLP's
part-of-speech tagger to identify phrases that describe some action
against the Chinese government. This approach might identify the
following phrase: ``Chinese citizens protest against the Communist
Party on June 4th''. We believe that using such culture-specific
phrases as search terms would enable us to discover even more websites
that are censored in China.
